Each July in New Orleans, the Crescent City hosts its own version of Spain’s Encierro de Pamplona. But instead of running from real bulls, runners from near and far gather in the traditional colors of Spain’s bull run and run from Big Easy Roller Derby, who chase runners with plastic bats on their roller skates.

Thousands of runners gather early in the morning in Downtown New Orleans to participate in the run, wearing all white with a dash of red. After the race, plenty of bars in the Warehouse District remain open all day to keep the festivities going.
